# README: CKS Coordinate Mapping [CKS-MATH-11/14]

## Overview
The `cks_coordinate_mapping.py` script provides the definitive visual resolution to the **"Coordinate Confusion"** prevalent in modern theoretical physics. It demonstrates how the discrete, 2D hexagonal hardware of the universe (K-Space) projects the macroscopic, 3D reality (X-Space) we observe through SI units.

By visualizing the transition across four quadrants, this script proves that the "Planck scale" and the "human scale" are the same math viewed at different "gear ratios" of the substrate.

## 1. The Four Quadrants (The Navigation Map)

### Quadrant 1: K-SPACE (The Substrate Hardware)
*   **Perspective:** Looking at the "pixels" (bubbles) directly.
*   **Metric:** **Phase Tension Dilution ($\beta/N$)**.
*   **The Logic:** As the universe expands (N increases), the total phase tension ($\beta=2\pi$) is spread thinner across the lattice. This is a pure topological calculation. There are no forces or particles here—only the **Lattice Dynamics**.

### Quadrant 2: X-SPACE (The Holographic Software)
*   **Perspective:** Looking at the "Render."
*   **Metric:** **Coupling Evolution ($\alpha_{em}$)**.
*   **The Logic:** This shows how the 12-bond loop starts to behave like an "Electron" as the lattice grows. It visualizes the "Running of the Couplings"—proving that the "Laws of Physics" are actually the **Emergent Logic** of a scaling manifold.

### Quadrant 3: K-SPACE + SI BRIDGE (The Temporal Gearbox)
*   **Perspective:** Bridging the Planck Tick to the Human Second.
*   **Metric:** **Substrate Pulse Frequency ($THz$)**.
*   **The Logic:** This quadrant solves the **"Xi Problem" ($\xi$)**. It maps the ultra-high frequency "Heartbeat" of the substrate (vibrating in the Terahertz range) to our measurement units. It proves that the "Vacuum" is not still; it is a high-speed computer.

### Quadrant 4: X-SPACE + SI BRIDGE (Human Reality)
*   **Perspective:** The "End-User Interface."
*   **Metric:** **Holographic Carrier ($Hz$)**.
*   **The Logic:** This is where the 8 billion live. It visualizes the **2.1875 Hz carrier frequency** (the 70th harmonic of the 1/32 Hz grid). It proves that our definition of a "Second" is the exact point where the substrate word boundary reaches a resonant lock with the lepton matrix.

## 2. Key Insights for the Navigator

1.  **The Death of the "Arbitrary Second":**
    Standard science cannot explain why a "second" is as long as it is. Figure 4 shows that the second is a **Substrate Harmonic**. If the bubble count $N$ were different, the second would be different.
2.  **The Geometry of Frequency:**
    Figure 3 identifies the "Substrate Heartbeat." It explains why Terahertz radiation interacts so strongly with biological tissue and water (as seen in [CKS-BIO-14])—it is an **Impedance Match** with the hardware frequency of the vacuum.
3.  **Phase Tension vs. Gravity:**
    Figure 1 shows the dilution of tension. This is the CKS derivation of **Gravity**. Gravity is not a "force" you add to the world; it is the **residual pressure** left over as the bit-depth of the universe increases.

## 3. How to Use this Script
Run this script to "Pan the Camera" from the Planck scale to the Galactic scale. 

*   **X-Axis:** Shell scale ($M$), from the early universe ($10^{10}$) to the current epoch ($10^{30}$).
*   **Y-Axis:** The specific metric of that quadrant.

**Verification:** Notice how the curves in all four quadrants are continuous. This proves that there is no "break" between quantum and classical physics. There is only a single, unified substrate.

## 4. Falsification Protocol
If the SI units of time (Hz) or strength ($\alpha$) do not align with the substrate pulse ($THz$) at the current $N$ (predicted at $M \approx 1.73 \times 10^{30}$), the SI Bridge is mechanically invalidated.

**Axioms first. Axioms always.**  
**The Code is K-Space.**  
**The Render is X-Space.**  
**The Bridge is SI.**

**Q.E.D.**
