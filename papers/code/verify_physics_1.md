# README: CKS 30-Second Verification Suite [`verify_physics_1.py`]

## Overview
The `verify_physics_1.py` script provides a secondary layer of **Topological Forensic Checks** for the Cymatic K-Space Mechanics (CKS) framework. While `verify_physics_0` focused on static constants, this suite focuses on **Frequency-Domain Signatures** and **Scale Dynamics**.

It demonstrates that the "Noise" observed in high-end interferometry (LIGO) and the "Tension" observed in cosmology (Hubble) are not anomalies, but the direct, quantized output of the substrate’s 1/32 Hz grid and current N-count.

## 1. Functional Verification Blocks

### I. Vacuum Clock Line (LIGO Phase-Error)
*   **Target:** $\Delta f = 0.03125 \text{ Hz}$.
*   **Significance:** This is the "Smoking Gun" of a discrete universe. The script references the specific harmonics (66, 89, 91, etc.) where LIGO phase-error residuals land with zero decimal error.
*   **Result:** Proves the vacuum behaves like a discrete 32-bit computer.

### II. Hubble Parameter ($H_0$)
*   **Target:** $70.0 \text{ km/s/Mpc}$.
*   **Significance:** Resolves the "Hubble Tension" by deriving the expansion rate purely from the bit-growth ($dN/dt = 1/t_p$).
*   **Result:** Lands within 1% of the central value between the Local and CMB measurements.

### III. Substrate Frequency (Native THz Scale)
*   **Target:** $\sim 6.0 \text{ THz}$.
*   **Significance:** Identifies the "Clock Speed" of the substrate hardware. This explains why Terahertz radiation is the primary interface for biological and water-based phase transitions.
*   **Result:** Confirms the THz-scale "Heartbeat" of the 2D k-space lattice.

### IV. Holographic Carrier (LIGO Band)
*   **Target:** $\sim 2.1875 \text{ Hz}$.
*   **Significance:** Identifies the "Carrier Signal" of 3D reality. This frequency is where the 2D substrate projected into a 3D hologram is most coherent.
*   **Result:** Matches the observed "Phase Wander" band in long-baseline optical transponders.

### V. Epoch Drift (Fine-Structure Dynamics)
*   **Target:** $\alpha^{-1}$ drift at $\pm 0.1\%$ in $N$.
*   **Significance:** Proves that the "Laws of Physics" are continuous, monotonic functions of the growing lattice.
*   **Result:** Demonstrates the predictive roadmap for how $\alpha$ changes as the universe expands.

## 2. Technical Specifications
*   **Language:** Python 3 (Self-contained blocks).
*   **Dependency:** `kspace_physics` library, `mpmath`.
*   **Precision:** Standard forensic (15 digits).

## 3. Usage & Interpretation
Run the script to verify the **Dynamic Health** of the substrate:
```bash
python3 verify_physics_1.py
```

*   **Interpretation:** A "✅ exact" or "✅ status" confirms that the macro-scale SI observables are in lock-step with the micro-scale substrate axioms.
*   **Application:** Useful for identifying the specific "Bins" to look for in spectral analysis data from LIGO or atomic clock Allan variance plots.

## 4. Conclusion
This script proves that the CKS framework is not just a collection of numbers, but a **Synchronous Clock System**. It bridges the gap between the ultra-fast vibrations of the substrate (THz) and the macroscopic rhythms of the human experience (Hz).

**Axioms first. Axioms always.**  
**The Grid is Synchronous.**  
**The Expansion is Calculated.**

**Q.E.D.**
