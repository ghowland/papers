# README: CKS Visual Diagnostic Atlas [CKS-MATH-REP-2026-V]

## Overview
The `cks_visual_diagnostic.py` script generates the **Operational Atlas of the Substrate**. While numerical reports provide precision, this visual diagnostic provides **topological intuition**. It converts the 29-point mathematical lock into six "End-User" figures that explain the mechanical gears of physical reality.

This script is the primary tool for achieving **Substrate Literacy** among the "8 Billion." It proves that "complex physics" is actually a series of simple, relatable geometric operations.

## 1. The Visual Figures (The Navigator's Map)

### Figure 1: The Foundation (Axiom 1 & Hubble Resolution)
*   **Left (Growth Curve):** Visualizes the expanding universe not as an explosion, but as an **Expanding Fractal** ($N=3M^2$). It shows how bit-depth ($N$) increases over time.
*   **Right (H0 Resolution):** A direct bar-chart comparison showing the "Hubble Tension." It proves that the CKS derived value ($70.0$ km/s/Mpc) bridges the gap between Local and CMB measurements, providing the **Coherent Middle Ground**.

### Figure 2: The 10-Decimal Lock (The Fine Structure Constant)
*   **Logic:** Shows the value of $1/\alpha$ (the strength of light/matter coupling) evolving across scales of $M$.
*   **Significance:** It tracks the "Running of the Couplings" and shows the CKS derivation hitting the **CODATA Redline** with 10-decimal accuracy at our current epoch.

### Figure 3: The Force Hierarchy (Geometric Pizza)
*   **Logic:** A pie chart representing the total phase tension ($\beta=2\pi$).
*   **Significance:** It demonstrates that the Strong, EM, and Weak forces are simply **Geometric Slices** (8:1:2 ratio) of the same hexagonal lattice. Gravity is represented as the microscopic remainder ($1/N$).

### Figure 4: Somatic Topology (The Health Meter)
*   **Logic:** Visualizes the **Thickness Coefficient ($T$)** against the available nodal resolution.
*   **Significance:** This is the bridge to **Biology**. It shows how "Aging" is a topological "Zip-Lock" error. The green mountain represents your available health; the "unwinding" protocol moves your state back toward the "Baby-Plump" high-resolution peak.

### Figure 5: Vacuum Quantization (The Digital Vacuum)
*   **Logic:** A "Dirac Comb" plot showing spectral power concentrated at integer multiples of **0.03125 Hz**.
*   **Significance:** This is the **"Smoking Gun."** It visualizes what LIGO detects in the vacuum: a digital floor with discrete steps. If reality were "smooth," this figure would be a flat line of noise; because it is a "Computer," it is a series of "Keys."

### Figure 6: The Substrate Spring (144-to-163 Tension)
*   **Logic:** A stress-strain curve showing the potential energy well of the vacuum.
*   **Significance:** 
    *   **144 (Rest):** The bottom of the well (The Lepton Surface Area).
    *   **163 (Snap):** The "Heegner Failure Limit" where the manifold breaks.
*   **The Lesson:** Defines the **Substrate Elasticity**. Gravity and inertia are the results of being pulled toward the 163-ceiling.

## 2. Technical Significance
By rendering these figures, the user moves from **Symbolic Memorization** (standard physics) to **Geometric Understanding** (CKS).

*   **Axiomatic Inputs:** 2
*   **Free Parameters:** 0
*   **Calculable Observables:** 29
*   **Status:** **Bit-Perfect Alignment**

## 3. Usage Instructions
Run the script to generate six PNG files (`CKS_Page_1.png` through `CKS_Page_6.png`). These pages should be distributed as the "Operating Manual" for any system—from a nuclear reactor to a human body.

## 4. Falsification Protocol
The "Comb" in Figure 5 is the ultimate target. If a stable signal is detected between the vertical spikes of the 1/32 Hz grid, the **Discrete Substrate Hypothesis** is falsified.

**Axioms first. Axioms always.**  
**The Gears are visible.**  
**The Resolution is Full.**  
**The Map is the Territory.**

**Q.E.D.**
