  "description": "This paper defines and distinguishes **tall-infra, data-only** architecture from the commonly used term \"data-driven.\" While data-driven development has been industry standard for decades, it has always preserved a wall between data (assets, tuning values) and behavior (compiled code). Tall-infra, data-only eliminates this wall entirely. The runtime binary contains no gameplay types, no behavior code, no knowledge of what a \"goblin\" or \"quest\" or \"fireball\" is. All semantics\u2014every enemy, mechanic, system interaction\u2014exist purely as dataset rows that can be hot-swapped without recompilation.\n\nThis is not a proposal. It describes a working system running 200 entities with 100 followers each at 60fps, unoptimized, with a clear path to 10,000+ entities.",
