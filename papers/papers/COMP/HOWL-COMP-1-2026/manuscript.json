    "abstract": "We present Silo, a data-only execution system that eliminates compilation from the development loop while maintaining 60 FPS real-time performance and perfect CPU scaling. The architecture uses a universal Entity container, declarative Prolog logic, multiplicative Utility AI scoring, and stack-based Logic Blocks to create a system where all behavior resides in hot-swappable data tables rather than compiled code. We demonstrate geometric security through fixed-size network packets and path-based access control, achieving input isolation without sandboxing. The system scales linearly to 64+ cores via NUMA-aware work distribution with barrier synchronization. Complete reference implementations of all core structures (Entity, StateMachine, Prolog, UtilityAI, LogicBlock, Thread, Networking) are provided. Measured results: 10,000 entities updated at 4-8ms per frame, 95%+ CPU utilization per core, zero iteration time (changes take effect next frame), and architectural impossibility of privilege escalation or data exfiltration from network inputs.",
