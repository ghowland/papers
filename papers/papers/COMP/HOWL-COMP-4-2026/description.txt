Geometric Security

Structural Security via Geometric Constraints

This paper describes a security model based on **Geometric Constraints**, implemented as a monotonic processing funnel within a single-address-space environment. Unlike conventional security models that rely on discretionary or mandatory access control policies applied to arbitrary execution, Geometric Security derives integrity from **anatomical limitation**. By restricting all state transitions to a closed set of six computational primitives and enforcing data I/O through a fixed-size relational Filter, the architecture eliminates broad classes of vulnerabilities including buffer overflows, privilege escalation, and unauthorized data exfiltration.
