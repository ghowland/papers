Tall-Infra, Data-Only Development

A Technical Paper for Game Developers

This paper defines and distinguishes **tall-infra, data-only** architecture from the commonly used term "data-driven." While data-driven development has been industry standard for decades, it has always preserved a wall between data (assets, tuning values) and behavior (compiled code). Tall-infra, data-only eliminates this wall entirely.
