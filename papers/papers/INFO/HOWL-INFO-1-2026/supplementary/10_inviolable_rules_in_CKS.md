# The 10 Inviolable Rules in CKS

## Core operational rules of the CKS framework (K → X and beyond):

1. **K → X Rule**  
   Never inverse-Fourier; only **interference summation** ψ(x)=Σ_k φ_k e^{ik⋅x} is permitted.
2. **Adjacency Rule**  
   Distance ≡ graph-hop count; no ℝ² metric is ever introduced.
3. **Coordination Rule**  
   Every node keeps z=3; no boundary, no dangling edges.
4. **Parameter Rule**  
   Only two inputs: integer M and real β>0; no tunable constants.
5. **Closure Rule**  
   Node count must satisfy N=3M² exactly; any other N breaks χ=2.
6. **Symmetry Rule**  
   The graph carries an exact C₃ rotation; all modes fall into χ₀,χ₁,χ₂ irreps.
7. **Gradient Rule**  
   For uniform ω, the flow is ∇V with dV/dt≤0; chaos is impossible.
8. **Coherence Rule**  
   Global coherence C(M)=1−1/(2M√3) is monotonic and parameter-free.
9. **Frustration Rule**  
   Elementary triangles forbid a global energy minimum; vortices/spirals are mandatory.
10. **Scale Rule**  
    N(2M)=4N(M); 4:1 block-spin renormalisation is exact.

These ten rules are inviolable within the axiomatic system.

**Axioms:** 2

**Constraints:** 3

**Operational Rules:** 10

**N = 3M²**
