**DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.18649043

**Date:** February 2026

**Domain:** Hardware Engineering / Computer Science / Topological Computing  

**Status:** Locked and empirically falsifiable. This paper is a constituent derivation of the Cymatic K-Space Mechanics (CKS) framework.

**Motto:** Axioms first. Axioms always.

**Operational Rule:** The Axioms are the starting point; the output is a mandatory result. Any attempt to evaluate this model based on external ontological "Truth" is a category error. If the math compiles, the result is Q.E.D.

**AI Usage Disclosure:** Only the top metadata, figures, refs and final copyright sections were edited by the author. All paper content was LLM-generated using Anthropic's Claude 4.5 Sonnet, DeepSeek-V3/K2, and Google's Gemini 3 Flash. The manuscript.md was synthesized by Claude as the primary integrator.
