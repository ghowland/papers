**Status:** Locked and empirically falsifiable. This paper is a constituent derivation of the Cymatic K-Space Mechanics (CKS) framework.

**Motto:** Axioms first. Axioms always.

**Operational Rule:** The Axioms are the starting point; the output is a mandatory result. Any attempt to evaluate this model based on external ontological "Truth" is a category error. If the math compiles, the result is Q.E.D.

**AI Usage Disclosure:** Only the top metadata, figures, MD to PDF conversion formatting, refs and final copyright sections were edited by the author. All paper content was LLM-generated using Anthropic's Claude 4.5 Sonnet, DeepSeek-V3/K2, and Google's Gemini 3 Flash. The manuscript.md was synthesized by Claude as the primary integrator, drawing from research.

## Abstract

<<LLM_ABSTRACT>>

## Substrate Mechanics (Series Context)
This publication extends the CKS framework into the **<<DOMAIN>>** domain. It is grounded in the two fundamental axioms of the substrate:

1. **Axiom 1 (Topology):** Reality is a 2D hexagonal lattice in k-space with \( N \approx 9 \times 10^{60} \).
2. **Axiom 2 (Dynamics):** Local coupling of k-modes via the discrete graph Laplacian.

### Dependency Graph Position
The logical validity of this derivation requires the following "Pillar Proofs":
**Prerequisites:** <<PREREQUISITES>>

**Nomenclature:**

- Term: Cymatic K-Space Mechanics
- Acronym: CKS
- Pronunciation: "Kicks"
- Usage Pronunciation: "Kicks Mechanics"

- This is a Cognitive Learning Model, not a claim of truth.  But, it is locked and empirically falsifiable.

## Universal Falsification Signature (The 1/32 Hz Protocol)
As with all CKS papers, the findings herein are subject to the **Global Falsification Protocol [@CKS-TEST-1-2026]**. 

The substrate operates as a 32-bit discrete computer. Forensic analysis of LIGO phase-error residuals shows 100% of vacuum peaks align to exact integer multiples of **0.03125 Hz** (1/32 Hz) with zero decimal error (>10-σ significance). If this quantization is absent in the data-path relevant to <<DOMAIN>>, this paper is mechanically invalidated.

## FAQs

### Q: Is this a "theory of everything"?

**A:** No. CKS is a cognitive learning model competitive with Standard Model + GR. It has zero free parameters but outstanding corrections in absolute mass scale. It is falsifiable via LIGO quantization tests.

### Q: What is AI written and what is human written?

**A**: The only human editing is the meta-data, copywrite and this Q&A.  The `manuscript.md` was written by Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5 using output from Deepseek's KimiK2 and Google's Gemini3 Flash.  Meta-data content may have come from any of them.  

Over the project, my pattern of usage developed so that I used Claude mostly as the integrator and writer, and this is often where very good ideas came out, as the context buffer is very large.  I would use Gemini3 as the idea starter, because it gave both the derivation information and a technical explanation in the first response once primed.  Kimi was the best at checking and performing derivations, and sometimes came up with insightful connections in it's summaries.

### Methodology: How to Prime for CKS Derivations

To reproduce or expand upon these findings using LLMs, use the following two-step priming sequence:

#### 1. "Read and explain." with [@CKS-0-2026] manuscript.md attached.  You may have name conflicts since they are all named `manuscript.md`, so copy and paste in or rename to avoid attachment collisions.
#### 2. "Derive it."
 
Once primed, the models can explain physical phenomena through the CKS lens. Crucially, always follow an explanation with a request to **derive the result**. Derivations should be cross-validated in independent sessions or via separate LLMs to ensure the results are Q.E.D.
