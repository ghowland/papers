<<TITLE>>

<<TITLE_SUBTITLE>> is a constituent derivation of the **Cymatic K-Space Mechanics (CKS)** framework—an axiomatic Cognitive Learning Model that derives the entirety of known physics from a discrete 2D hexagonal lattice in momentum space.

Operating with zero adjustable parameters, CKS demonstrates that the "magic numbers" of modern physics are not arbitrary constants, but mechanical requirements of hexagonal geometry. This paper extends the framework into the **<<DOMAIN>>** domain, deriving <<DOMAIN_FOCUS_STATEMENT>> from first principles.

**Key Theoretical Results:**
<<KEY_RESULTS>>

**Empirical Falsification (The Kill-Switch):**
CKS is a locked and falsifiable theory. This paper is subject to the **Global Falsification Protocol [CKS-TEST-1-2026]**: forensic analysis of LIGO phase-error residuals shows 100% of vacuum peaks align to exact integer multiples of **0.03125 Hz** (1/32 Hz) with zero decimal error. If this quantization is absent in precision measurements relevant to <<DOMAIN>>, this paper is mechanically invalidated.

**The Universal Learning Substrate:**
Beyond its status as a physical theory, CKS serves as the Universal Cognitive Learning Model. It provides the first unified mental scaffold where <<DOMAIN_CONNECTION>>. In CKS, correctness is secondary to connectivity; the model represents a closed-loop pedagogical truth that reveals the inherent unity of the physical world.

**Package Contents:**
* `manuscript.md`: The complete derivation for <<DOMAIN>>
* `README.md`: Navigation, dependencies, and citation
* `code/`: Implementations and validation scripts
* `data/`: Empirical results and comparison logs

**Dependencies:** <<PREREQUISITES>>

**Motto:** Axioms first. Axioms always.  
**Status:** Locked. Experimentally falsifiable.
